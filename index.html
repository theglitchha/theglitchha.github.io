            <div style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <p>
                    I have worked on a lot of projects in the past,
                    many of which have not turned out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I see this as a very good thing. Why? Because rather than working on
                    a ton of projects at once, I effectively narrowed down which ones did
                    not motivate me as much, or which ones simply weren't interesting enough.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The projects that didn't work out were good learning experiences, however,
                    and I wouldn't be where I am without them. <br> You can think of game dev
                    like a staircase, but the stairs progressively get taller proportional to
                    the stair below it. An example of this idea would be if the stair below
                    you is 1/2 feet tall, then the stair you are standing on is 3/4 feet tall,
                    and the stair above you is 1 foot tall. Something like where you'd have to
                    lift your leg up even higher than it took to step up the previous stair.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The idea is that it takes a whole lot of practice. The stair below you
                    helps prepare you for the stairs ahead.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I do rememeber my first idea for a game. It was about a spacecraft prison
                    that crashlanded, and you play as one of the surviving prisoners, trying
                    to rebuild the ship and gather resources. There were many attempts at this
                    game idea. I had even made an entire soundtrack for it (it wasn't very good.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    I could talk about game dev all day. But that's not the point.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
                <p style="color: red;"> 
                    You came to see cool game. I do have game to show you, but it's
                    up to you to decide if game is cool or not. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, there are 2 games to see. As mentioned earlier, these are
                    the projects that lasted the longest, and have been the most
                    fun and challenging to work on.
                </p>

            <div class="clearfix" id="fpstool" style="margin-bottom: 100px;">
                <h1 style="color: teal;"> FPS Tool</h1>

                <p>
                    I know what you must be thinking. What is a tool? That's not a game.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Well, actually, the idea of FPS Tool is that it is a framework. It is
                    a multiplayer first person shooter system. I plan on turning it into 
                    a game when it is finished, of course under a different name though.
                    I started this not too long ago, and I'm having a blast working on it.
                </p>
                <img src="images/fps_tool_1.png" alt="fps_tool_1" style="float: right; max-width: 75%; max-height: 450px;">
                <img src="images/fps_tool_2.png" alt="fps_tool_2" style="float: right; max-width: 75%; max-height: 450px;">
                <img src="images/fps_tool_3.png" alt="fps_tool_3" style="float: right; max-width: 75%; max-height: 450px;">
                <p>
                    The kicker is that it is quite bland in its current state. There
                    are a lot of systems in place for different things, such as loadouts,
                    guns, gun attachments, game modes, parkour, etc. There were just
                    multiplayer-related issues that took priority, so I haven't got to
                    implement game modes yet. Therefore, there is nothing to do while
                    testing the game except test game mechanics, which gets boring fast.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a devlog for this game on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@theglitchha" target="_blank"> youtube</a>. 
                    It's not a serious devlog, it's supposed to be silly, and it just shows off progress for the game.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can view more information about this game <a href="fpstool.html" target="_self"> here</a>.

            <div class="clearfix" id="turbonova" style="margin-bottom: 400px;">
                <h1 style="color: red;"> Turbonova</h1>

                <p>
                    Turbonova is a 90s-like console that does not exist.
                    Users can create their own "discs" and play other people's.
                </p>

                <img src="images/turbonova_3d.png" alt="turbonova_2d" style="float: right; max-width: 75%; max-height: 450px;">
                
                <p>
                    The beta release will just include preset games to play. I had
                    started on the editor for users, but I realized that it'd be way
                    too much to include in the beta.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I made a system so that games could be made outside of the editor,
                    so that it'd be easier to develop official games for it.
                </p>
